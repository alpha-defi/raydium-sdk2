title: Requirements
---

The tutorials assume general knowledge of Solana and Web2 development but before attempting any
of the tutorials, please check that your machine has the following basic
requirements:

- A web browser like [Brave](https://brave.com/)
- A Solana compatiable wallet like [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)

For development, it's recommeneded you switch Phantom to devnet so that you do not need
to invest any money for development purposes.

This can be done by opening your Phantom wallet, clicking the bottom right gear icon,
Clicking "Change Network", and then selecting "Devnet"
